This Ridebook has an API LEVEL 29 and I am using it on PIXEL 3 XL. There are 4 classes here: ride, ride_adding_activity,time_picker, MainActivity.java.
The video was done on the in built video maker, which is why there might be some trouble in the graphics sometimes.
Some of the code was directly learned by me from online sources for example the Time picker fragment and the date picker.

The video might have some minor differences with the final code, but overall these are just some minor formatting changes.

Coding in flow: this is an online YOUTUBE CHANNEL where I learnt some of the practices
And some other channels where I self learnt as a new programmer to Android Studio.

Enjoy!
